## Functional Works:

1. Make a user list page where I want to see all the “Users” in a card view.
   - List all the users in a card layout as the page loads.
   - Each card will show the following information about the users:
     - Avatar
     - First Name
     - Last Name
     - Email
     - Address (Street, Suite, City)
     - Company Name
2. As a user, If I click on a user’s name, it will open a separate page and will show user details with the following information:
   - Avatar
   - First Name
   - Last Name
   - Email
   - Address (Street, Suite, City)
   - Company Name
3. Add a search input field to the top of the list. If I type here, it will search based on the user's name.
4. Add a select input field to the top of the list to sort the users with the following options:
   - Sort by name
   - Sort by email
   - Sort by Company name
5. Add a form in the user list page where I can add users with all the information mentioned above.

## Design (UI):

1. The app should look clean.
2. Show each user's information in separate cards. Show cards in per row:
